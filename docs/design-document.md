- halfway through the game, the main character finds a cute new companion.
- as the game progresses, the character starts feeling like something is chasing them, shadows start appearing and attacking them.
- near the end, you realize that this whole time, the little girl is echidna, and she and her other monsters have been trying to find her lost pet (we don't know which yet).
- turns out your companion is that pet, and they killed everyone.
- main character dies.
