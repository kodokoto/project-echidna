### Mechanics
- Light is dictated by a players candle (which goes down over time)
- when the candle goes out, the player is in the dark
- when the player is in the dark, they can't see anything, and they start dying bit by bit

## Story:


### Scratch plot
- Main character wakes up in a strange dark place (orphanage?), with broken furniture and the occasional corpse (dead orphans). The only thing they have is a broken, rusty lockert, and on the ground next to them is a candle holder.
- They find notes throughout the game, which tell a story of how a young girl lost her pet.
- halfway through the game, the main character finds a cute new companion.
- as the game progresses, the character starts feeling like something is chasing them, shadows start appearing and attacking them.
- near the end, you realize that this whole time, the little girl is echidna, and she and her other monsters have been trying to find her lost pet (we don't know which yet).
- turns out your companion is that pet, and they killed everyone.
- main character dies.

### Pre-Story
- Thousands of years ago some unknown hero, a son of hecate, traps one of cerberus' heads and seals it inside of a locket.

- cut forward to mid-late 1800s, a child is left at the steps of an orphange with a locket around its neck.

- baited by cerberus in their dreams, the child is unwillingly coaxed into opening up the locket with their strong emotions, something that wasnt possible with previous heirs as they werent as sad and angry as the orphan.

- cerberus' head (the pet) escapes and starts killing the orphans while the main character is knocked out, loosing their memory.

- meanwhile, the gods sense the disturbance and send echidna to capture the pet.

- the game unfolds.
